# Code style
- TypeScript/JavaScript: Don't use semicolons 
- Use TypeScript for all the things, not JavaScript.
- Use tailwindcss / skeleton for UI components, forms, layout, etc

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
